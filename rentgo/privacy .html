	<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p id="p">8 June 2023<br><br>

First things first – your privacy is important to us. That might be the kind of thing all these notices say, but we mean it.<br>
 You place your trust in us by using Booking.com services and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and<br>
 safeguarding your personal data. We act in our customers’ best interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal data.<br><br>

This document (‘this Privacy Statement’ or ‘our Privacy Statement’) describes how we use and process your personal data,<br>
 provided in a readable and transparent manner. It also tells you what rights you can exercise in relation to your personal data<br>
 and how you can contact us. Please also read our Cookie Statement, which tells you how Booking.com uses cookies and other similar<br>
 tracking technologies.<br><br>

If you’ve used us before, you know that Booking.com offers online travel-related services through our own websites and mobile apps,<br>
 as well as other online platforms such as partners’ websites and social media. We’d like to point out that all the information you<br>
 are about to read, generally applies to not one, not two, but all of these platforms.<br><br>

In fact, this single privacy statement applies to any kind of customer information we collect through all of the above platforms<br>
 or by any other means connected to these platforms (such as when you contact our customer service team by email).<br><br>

If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also check out our Privacy Statement for Business Partners to understand how <br>
personal data is further processed as part of the business relationship.<br><br>

We might amend this Privacy Statement from time to time, so we recommend you visit this page occasionally to make sure you know <br>
where you stand. If we make any updates to this Privacy Statement that will impact you significantly, we’ll notify you about the <br>
changes before any new activities begin.<br><br>

<label id ="l"><b>Terms we use in this Privacy Statement</b></label>
<p id="p">'Trip' means the various different travel products and services that can be ordered, acquired, purchased, bought, paid, rented,<br>
 provided, reserved, combined, or consummated by you from the Trip Provider.<br><br>

'Trip Provider' means the provider of accommodation (e.g. hotel, motel, apartment, bed & breakfast, landlord), attractions (e.g. (theme)<br>
 parks, museums, sightseeing tours), transportation provider (e.g. car rentals, cruises, rail, airport rides, coach tours, transfers), <br>
 tour operators, travel insurances and any other travel or related product or service as from time to time available for Trip Reservation <br>
 on the platform.<br><br>

'Trip Service' means the online purchase, order, (facilitated) payment or reservation service as offered or enabled by Rent & Go in <br>
respect of various products and services as from time to time made available by Trip Providers on the platform.<br><br>

'Trip Reservation' means the order, purchase, payment, booking or reservation of a Trip.<br>

<hr>
<label id="l"><b>What kind of personal data does Rent & Go collect?</b></label>
<p id="p">
We can’t help you book the perfect Trip without information, so when you use our services there are certain things we ask for. <br>
This is typically routine information – your name, preferred contact details, the names of the people travelling with you and your payment<br>
 information. You might also decide to submit additional information related to your upcoming Trip (for example, your anticipated arrival time).<br><br>
 

In addition to this, we also collect information from the computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access our services. This includes the <br>
IP address, the browser you’re using and your language settings. There are also situations in which we receive information about you from<br>
 others or when we automatically collect other information.<br><br>

This is the general overview but if you’d like to know more about the information we collect, we go into more detail below.</p>
