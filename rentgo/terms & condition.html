        <center><h1><b>Terms & Conditions</b></h1></center>
        <h2><b>Definition</b></h2>
        <p>Some of the words you’ll see have very specific meanings, so please check out the ‘Rent & Go’ at the end of these Terms.</p>

        <h2><b>About these terms</b></h2>
        <p>When you complete your Booking, you accept these Terms and any other terms that you’re provided with during the booking process.<br/> 
           If anything in these Terms is (or becomes) invalid or, unenforceable:</p>

           <li>it will still be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law</li>
           <li>you will still be bound by everything else in the Terms.</li>

        <p>These Terms are laid out like this:</p>
        
        <p><b>Section A:</b> general terms, for all types of Travel Experiences.</p>
        <p><b>Sections B to F: </b> specific terms, for just one type of Travel Experience:</p>
        <p><b>Section B:</b> Accommodations</p>
        <p><b>Section C:</b> Attractions</p>
        <p><b>Section D:</b> Car rentals</p>
        <p><b>Section E:</b> Flights</p>
        <p><b>Section F:</b> Private and Public Transport</p>

        <p>If there’s any mismatch between general and specific terms, the specific terms will apply.<br/>
          The English version of these Terms is the original. If there’s any dispute about the Terms, or any
          mismatch between the Terms in English and in another language, the Terms as they appear in
          English will apply.<br/></p>

          <h2><b>About Rent & Go</b></h2>
          <p>1.&nbsp; When you book an accommodation, flight or attraction, Rent & Go provides and is responsible for the
            Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (see A4.4 below).<br/>
            2. When you book a rental car, or private or public transport, Rent & Go Transport Limited provides and is responsible
            for the Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (see A4.4 below).<br/>
            3. We work with companies that provide local support services (e.g. Customer Support or account management). They don’t:</p>

            <li>control or manage our Platform</li>
            <li>have their own Platform</li>
            <li>have any legal or contractual relationship with you</li>
            <li>provide Travel Experiences</li>
            <li>represent us, enter into contracts or accept legal documents in our name</li>
            <li>operate as our ‘process or service agents’.</li>

            <h2><b>Our Platform</b></h2>
          <p>1. We take reasonable care in providing our Platform, but we can’t guarantee that everything on it is accurate
            (we get information from the Service Providers). To the extent permitted by law, we can’t be held responsible for any errors,
            any interruptions, or any missing bits of information - although we will do everything we can to correct/fix them as soon as we can.<br/><br/>
            2. Our Platform is not a recommendation or endorsement of any Service Provider or its products, services, facilities, vehicles, etc.<br/><br/>
            3. We’re not a party to the terms between you and the Service Provider. The Service Provider is solely responsible for the Travel Experience.<br/><br/>
            4. To make a Booking, you may need to create an Account. Please make sure all your info (including payment and contact details) is correct
            and up to date, or you might find you can’t access your Travel Experience(s). You’re responsible for anything that happens with your
            Account, so please don’t let anyone else use it, and please keep your username and password secret.<br/><br/>
            5. We will show you the offers that are available to you, in (what we think is) the right language for you. You can change to
            another language whenever you like.<br/><br/>
            6. Unless otherwise indicated, you need to be at least 16 to use the Platform.</p><br/>

            <h2><b>Prices</b></h2>

            <p>1. When you make a Booking, you accept the applicable policies as displayed in the booking process. You'll find
              each Service Provider's cancellation policy and any other policies (about age requirements, security/damage deposits, additional
              supplements for group Bookings, extra beds, breakfast, pets, cards accepted, etc.) on our Platform: on the Service Provider information
              pages, during the booking process, in the fine print, and/or in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable).<br/><br/>
              2. If you cancel a Booking or don’t show up, any cancellation/no-show fee and any refund will depend on the Service Provider’s
              cancellation/no-show policy.<br/><br/>
              3. Some Bookings can’t be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled for free before a deadline.<br/><br/>
              4. If you book a Travel Experience by paying in advance (including all price components and/or a damage deposit if applicable),
              the Service Provider may cancel the Booking without notice if they can't collect the balance on the date specified.
              If they do, any non-refundable payment you’ve made will only be refunded at their discretion. It's your responsibility
              to make sure the payment goes ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are correct, and that there's
              enough money available in your account).<br/><br/>
              5. If you think you're not going to arrive on time, please contact your Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you,
              so they don't cancel your Booking. If you’re late, we are not liable for the consequences (e.g. the cancellation of your Booking,
              or any fees the Service Provider may charge).<br/><br/>
              6. As the person making the Booking, you are responsible for the actions and behaviour (in relation to the Travel Experience) of everyone
              in the group. You are also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with their personal data.</p>
